Summary:This project aims to create a machine learning model for identifying breast cancer using diagnostic characteristics. The dataset comprises attributes obtained from breast mass images, and the model forecasts whether the mass is benign or malignant.

Goals:-

Determine if a breast lump is benign or malignant. *Enhance model efficiency for precision and dependability.
Techniques:- *Data preparation: Addressing absent values, standardization, and dividing the dataset. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the distributions and connections of features. *Model creation: Establishing and educating machine learning models. *Assessment: Evaluating model effectiveness through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Essential Elements:- *Dataset: Attributes encompass average radius, texture, perimeter, and additional factors. *Algorithms: Employed classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. *Assessment Metrics: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification summary.
